This Babel plugin is for marking Forge UI JSX components
with unique key (property) `__auxId`.

The purpose of the key is to be consistent between renders,
even when the code around it is inconsistent like this:

```jsx
{showButtonOne && <Button text="Hello" />}
<Button text="World" />
```

Without this Babel plugin, the "World" button may be marked `Button.0` or `Button.1`,
depending on the value of `showButtonOne`.
